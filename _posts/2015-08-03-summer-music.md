I am still amazed how the pop music industry is capable of ingest and recycle old fashioned beats and styles.

These two songs from **Demi Lovato** and **Selena Gomez** respectively, prove it once again. 

The flow and the beat are differents, but they come from the same place. 

**Selena Gomez** could have been a hip-hop artist but instead she stays at the border of genra, between cold wave and hip-hop.

The other is just a big rip-off of the 80's synth golden era. I am very sensitive to this **new wave** with artists like **College** or **Kavinsky**.

I always have enjoyed to listen to this music. Even if it is easy, there is as much soul in it as in my toaster.

But it is well done. 

The production is literally flawless. I never took the time to look at the name of the producers of these tracks in general, but I am really astonished each time by their virtuosity.

**Hollywood Records**, or **Disney** to name it, has really mastered the art of producing. And for that, you have my ears until your next catchy song or **Miley Cyrus**.

*Because there is limits.*
