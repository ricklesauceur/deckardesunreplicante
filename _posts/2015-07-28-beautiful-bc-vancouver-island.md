After a long week-end in Vancouver Island.

Departure from Tsawwsannen harbour.
Having walk to the south of the Island passing By Victoria, I definitely want to see the rest.

*There is something particular about the fog on the south coast.*
*It gives you this unique filter, with sun beams piercing through it.*

I finally returned by foot from **Nanaimo** to **Horseshoe Bay**.

I had the chance to cross the sight of a beautiful blond hair girl.
She was queuing in line for the bike to embark.

I was a bit overwhelmed, it is a rare feeling that I cannot explain.

Sadly, I was too **shy** to say hello.

I still think about it, a missed moment that you regret and **fantasized** about.

It makes me wonder, if I am still capable of **romance**.

And that dear readers, is the power of natural space and freedom...

... and also a deeply **melancholic** writer, you know the deal.
