In front of a a community of the French Assembly, **Jean Marc Jancovici** presented his vision of climatic change.

The idea behind his presentation is classic among French scientific. 

Each time we perform something, not using our own strength, we consume energy. This energy is represented by the concept of **energetic slave**.

A slave by his first definition is a person who need to deliver his own strength to produce something. 

Each person in France consume 600 energetic slaves per day. 

It means that our way of life, without machine or energetic solution like petroleum and electricity, would need 600 others persons each to be possible.

He also demonstrates the link between energy availability and growth. 

I am personally completely synced with his thinking. 

**Science**.
