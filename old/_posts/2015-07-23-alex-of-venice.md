You may think I have an obsession with **Mary Elizabeth Winstead**.

And you would be **right**.

This little indie movie narrates the story of a woman, overwhelmed by his work, missing to live her life.

The story is a little weak in a sense. Stakes are not very credible but that's not really the point either.

This actress can convey fragility but also fierce and determination. 

Sometimes you just want to shoot in the rain, and it is exactly what this film is good for:

To convey nostalgia and bad stories, so good moments can **come back**.

*I want the ecstasy please*.
